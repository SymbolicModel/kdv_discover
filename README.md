# Learning the KdV equation from data
Data and script for the mini Hackathon to recover the Kortewegâ€“De Vries equation from spatio-temporal data.

## Prerequiste
Make sure you have SciPy and NumPy and Matplotlib installed.
```
!pip install scipy numpy matplotlib pandas pysindy pysr
```

## Getting Started
Go to `PySINDy.ipynb` or `PySR.ipynb` to get started!

## Know about the data
While the notebooks can get you started, it's a good idea to see what the data files actually contain. Check `kdv_data_readme.txt` to check out what the data file actually contain!

## Solution
The answer to this learning problem can be found in the `*_Solution` notebooks of this repo. Try not to look at the answer and have a go yourself first!
